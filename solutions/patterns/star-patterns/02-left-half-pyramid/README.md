# Left Half Pyramid

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Write a Java program to print a Left Half Pyramid star pattern.
The pyramid should be aligned to the right side, with stars (*) increasing in each row.
The number of rows is fixed (for example, n = 5), and proper spacing should be added to align the stars in a left-half pyramid shape.

## Output
```
        *
      * *
    * * *
  * * * *
* * * * *
```

The program prints a left-half pyramid star pattern using nested loops.  
- The outer loop controls the number of rows.  
- The first inner loop prints spaces for alignment.  
- The second inner loop prints stars in each row.  
- Each new row increases the number of stars and decreases the spaces, forming a left-half pyramid.
