The program prints a left-half pyramid star pattern using nested loops.  
- The outer loop controls the number of rows.  
- The first inner loop prints spaces for alignment.  
- The second inner loop prints stars in each row.  
- Each new row increases the number of stars and decreases the spaces, forming a left-half pyramid.
