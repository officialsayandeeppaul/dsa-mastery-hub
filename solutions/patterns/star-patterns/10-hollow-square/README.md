The program prints a hollow square pattern using nested loops.  
- The outer loop runs through all rows (`1 to n`).  
- The first and last rows print all stars.  
- The middle rows print stars only at the first and last positions, filling the rest with spaces.  
- This creates a square shape with a hollow center.
