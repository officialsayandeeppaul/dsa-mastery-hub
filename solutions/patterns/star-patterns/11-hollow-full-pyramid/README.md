This program prints a **hollow full pyramid** using nested loops:

- The **outer loop** runs from `1` to `n` (each row).
- The **first inner loop** prints leading spaces to align the pyramid shape.
- For each row:
  - If it's the **first or last row**, stars are printed in all positions.
  - Otherwise, stars are printed only at the **first and last positions** of the row, leaving the center **hollow**.
- A newline (`println`) is used after each row to move to the next line.
