The program prints an inverted full pyramid using nested loops.  
- The outer loop controls the number of rows.  
- The first inner loop prints spaces to center the stars.  
- The second inner loop prints stars in each row.  
- As the row number increases, spaces increase and stars decrease, forming an inverted full pyramid.
