The program prints an inverted left half pyramid using nested loops.  
- The outer loop controls the number of rows.  
- The first inner loop prints spaces before the stars.  
- The second inner loop prints stars in each row.  
- As the row number increases, spaces increase and stars decrease, forming an inverted left-aligned pyramid.
