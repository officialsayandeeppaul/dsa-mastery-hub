The program prints a full pyramid star pattern using nested loops.  
- The outer loop controls the number of rows.  
- The first inner loop prints spaces before the stars.  
- The second inner loop prints stars in each row.  
- As the row number increases, spaces decrease and stars increase, forming a full pyramid.
