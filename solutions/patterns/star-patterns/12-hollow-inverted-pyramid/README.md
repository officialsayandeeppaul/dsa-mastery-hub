This program prints a **hollow inverted full pyramid** using nested loops:

- The **outer loop** (`i`) runs from `1` to `n` (each row).
- The **first inner loop** prints **leading spaces** that increase with each row to invert the pyramid.
- If the row is the **first or last**, it prints all stars.
- Otherwise, it prints a star only at the **first and last column positions**, leaving the inside **hollow**.
- After each row, a newline is printed.
